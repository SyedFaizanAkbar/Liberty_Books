  <p>
    Rowley has written his own story of life in middle-school- but he's also agreed to play the role of biographer for
    Greg along the way.

    (After all, one day Greg will be rich and famous, and everyone will need to know his life's story.)

    But, it will soon become clear that Rowley is a poor choice for the job, and Greg's biography is less a future
    masterpiece, and more a hilarious mess.<br /><br />
